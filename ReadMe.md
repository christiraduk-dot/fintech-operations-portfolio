# Payments Reconciliation & Discrepancy Analysis

## Objective
Simulate a FinTech payments operations workflow and perform transaction-to-settlement reconciliation.

## Business Context
In payment systems, not all transactions settle immediately due to refunds, chargebacks, or failures. Operations teams must reconcile transaction records against settlement reports to ensure payout accuracy and financial control.

## Process
- Created transaction and settlement datasets
- Reconciled transactions against settlements using lookup logic
- Identified missing settlements and amount mismatches
- Classified reconciliation outcomes (OK, Missing, Mismatch)
- Summarized reconciliation results for operational monitoring

## Key Findings
- Missing settlements detected for refunded and chargeback transactions
- Amount mismatches identified due to partial settlements
- Reconciliation summary highlights operational risk areas

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets / Excel
